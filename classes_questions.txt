Lab Questions:

1. Model Comparison Results:
   - Logistic Regression: 83.80% accuracy
   - Random Forest: 79.89% accuracy  
   - XGBoost: 83.24% accuracy
   - Best performing model: Logistic Regression (83.80%)

2. What can we still improve?
   - Hyperparameter tuning for all models
   - Cross-validation instead of single train-test split
   - Feature selection and engineering optimization
   - Model interpretability and feature importance analysis
   - Better handling of class imbalance
   - Add more evaluation metrics (AUC-ROC, precision-recall curves)
   - Implement model serialization with versioning
   - Add logging and experiment tracking
   - Create configuration files for model parameters
   - Add unit tests for all classes
   - Implement data validation steps
   - Add model monitoring for data drift
